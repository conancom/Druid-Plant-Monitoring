# Druid-Plant-Monitoring

## Project Description

  Druid is a plant monitoring system that monitors and displays useful information about the surrounding environment, such as soil moisture, weather, and air quality, to help you plan to manage your garden. Our project uses Bluetooth that connects to an application on your mobile phone. It will send you notifications if the environment suddenly changes or its value becomes overwhelming in order to make you aware and prevent a disaster like a rainstorm, tornado, or drought.
